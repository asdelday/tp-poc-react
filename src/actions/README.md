ACTIONS
=====================
```
This folder (actions) stores the app Redux actions.
```
Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. 
They are the only source of information for the store.

Actions are plain JavaScript objects. 
Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. 
Types should typically be defined as string constants.
