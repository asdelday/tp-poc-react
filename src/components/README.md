COMPONENTS
=====================
```
This folder (components) stores the dumb components.
```
These components are characterized by:
* No dependencies on the rest of the app
* Often allow containment via this.props.children
* Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props
* Have CSS associated with them
* Rarely have their own state
* Might use other dumb components
